According to this logic, the expected reference would be to the zib HealthcareProvider Location profile (<http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-HealthcareProvider>) rather than the Organization profile (<http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-HealthcareProvider-Organization>). However, on a functional level this concept is usually understood to be about the organization rather than the location, which is in line with the way FHIR models the current element. For this reason, the Organization rather than the Location resource is referenced here. See https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/MM-4747 for more information.",
